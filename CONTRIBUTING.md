# Contributing guidelines

This document outlines guides to get started on developing the starter kit.

## Contributing to the docs

Contributions to the docs are also welcome! We've documented the steps to do so [here](./docs/in-depth/contributing.md).

## The Five Golden Rules

The simple steps of contributing to any GitHub project are as follows:

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter/fork)
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push -u origin my-new-feature`
5. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/barthogenes/screeps-b-ai/pulls)!

Please check the following things before submitting a PR:
* Your code must pass all of the linter checks (`npm run lint`)
* All tests pass
